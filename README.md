# 7ZipFrontEnd
This is a graphical front-end specifically made for the Mac version of 7-zip, which is command-line only. Since some of my students aren't comfortable with the command line tools yet, this tool is designed to make their lives a little easier. It is written in JavaScript using Electron, since they learn JavaScript during their studies,.
